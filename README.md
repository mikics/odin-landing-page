# The Odin Project: Landing Page

This repository contains the source code for the "Landing Page" project, the final assignment for the CSS section of the course.

## Notes

I am having troubles figuring out what to do with the image when zooming out/in. I think that the image should keep its aspect ratio, and, when appropriate, should wrap onto the next row. I am not sure if a flexbox is the best solution in this case.
